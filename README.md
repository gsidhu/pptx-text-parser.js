# PPTX Text Parser
A minimal, pure JavaScript parser for pptx files. It will extract all the text from the slides and return it as a string or a JSON object.

## Installation
```bash
npm i pptx-text-parser
```

### Dependencies
This module requires the following dependencies:
- [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip/)
- [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js)

## Usage
To extract the text as a string, use:
```javascript
const pptxTextParser = require('pptx-text-parser');

pptxTextParser.parse('path/to/pptx/file.pptx', _mode="text")
  .then((text) => {
    console.log(text);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

To extract the text as a JSON object, use:
```javascript
const pptxTextParser = require('pptx-text-parser');

pptxTextParser.parse('path/to/pptx/file.pptx', _mode="json")
  .then((textJSON) => {
    console.log(textJSON);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

## Testing
Note: The contents of the [`sample.pptx`](https://github.com/gsidhu/pptx-text-parser.js/blob/main/sample.pptx) file were generated using OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

You can test the module on the `sample.pptx` file like so:
```javascript
let sampleFilepath = "./sample.pptx";
parse(sampleFilepath, _mode="text").then((result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
```

Switch `_mode` to `"json"` to get the output as a JSON object.


## Sample Output
